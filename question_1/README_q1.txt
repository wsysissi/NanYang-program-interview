input of the code is like the example below:

e.g.we want to find the operations of a mxn matrix with the sum=k

type"outf.write(main(m,n,k))"at the end of this program


Since the value of each member in a row of the matrix given in the example is
equal to the serial number of that row, the matrix generated in code_question_1_x.py 
is also of this form. however, it can be replaced with other matrices in other cases.

But the time complexity of the computation way in the code_question_1_1.py is so large 
that it could hardly manage to compute the solution of the second question.

However,there still have an other arithmetic to solve the second question, which 
is based on the typical type of matrix the question's example has given that the 
value of each member in a row of the matrix is equal to the serial number of that row.
you can see the way in code_question_1_2.py
