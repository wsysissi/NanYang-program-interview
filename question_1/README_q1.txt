input of the code is like the example below:

e.g.we want to find the operations of a mxn matrix with the sum=k

type"outf.write(main(m,n,k))"at the end of this program


Since the value of each member in a row of the matrix given in the example is
equal to the number of that row, the matrix generated in this code is also of this form,
but can be replaced with other matrices in other cases.
